Let us know in the comments \ud83d\udc47 \n\nEx-Professional cyclist Simon Richardson takes a look at what was the start of clothing brand ASSOS, a bike. Yep, that's right, they started with a bike!\n\nCarbon fibre was already on the scene in motorsports and skiing, with that in mind, Toni Maier the founder of ASSOS decided to give it a go in the bike industry. 1976 was the year, and the rest is well, history!\n\nWhy carbon? It could be manipulated into various shapes, which was very appealing to Toni Maier and ASSOS.\n\nThe lugs have an internal socket where the tubes meet one another and are bonded together.\n\nThe tube profiles have a teardrop shape and performed significantly better than any of its competitors back in 1976.\n\nThe rims were also produced by ASSOS, 16mm wide and designed with aerodyamics in mind to match the ultra narrow tubulars. (which look to be Barum from memory, Jon)\n\nThe handlebars were placed on the fork crown to get the rider as low as possible, ideal for pursuit\/kilometre events on the track. Remember, this is before TT bars were conceived. \n\nFrom this point forward the ASSOS clothing brand was born, and aerodynamic clothing too. Lycra was born, and even pro cyclists were buying ASSOS products for \"special events\".\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link \ud83d\udc4d  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/oB\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nRohan Dennis' BMC Timemachine 01 | Vuelta A Espa\u00f1a 2017 \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/or\nHow To Get More Aero On Your Road Bike \u2013 With Zipp \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/2g1KErl\n\nPhotos: \u00a9 Bettiniphoto \/ http:\/\/www.bettiniphoto.net\/ & \u00a9Tim De Waele \/ http:\/\/www.tdwsport.com\n\nAbout GCN:\n\nThe Global Cycling Network puts you in the centre of the action: from the iconic climbs of Alpe D\u2019Huez and Mont Ventoux to the cobbles of Flanders, everywhere there is road or pav\u00e9, world-class racing and pro riders, we will be there bringing you action, analysis and unparalleled access every week, every month, and every year.
