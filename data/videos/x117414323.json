        "description": "The Launch assignment:  To show how world champions like Serena Williams, Dwayne Wade and Drew Brees keep their cool when it\u2019s all on the line. The answer? MISSION Athletecare\u2122, the world\u2019s first and only line of Athlete-Engineered\u2122 products and the breakout leader in the Thermoregulation category.  Mission wanted a campaign that simply put, lived up to the name MISSION. For Launch, that meant turning MISSON into a state of mind that inspired people to push to their limits and beyond! With a series of high-octane short form and digital spots featuring our world-renowned athletes, Serena Williams Dwayne Wade and Drew Brees, we let their athleticism and drive for perfection, tell the story for us. Shooting at varied frame rates with our Alexa along with \u2018up close and personal\u2019 hand-held footage, viewers can feel the gritty sweat and realism it takes to be your personal best, followed by the instant cooling relief achieved with MISSON Cooling Towels. Launch was also engaged to produce the Amazon Echo spots for the MISSION campaign.",
