With some interesting findings from a recent scientific study, we reveal the answers. But are they what you expected? We'd love to know why YOU ride - tell us in the comments below. \ud83d\udcac\n\nThere's more news from the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, Canyon is in the USA, Temple Cycles prove to be a modern business and there's plenty of pro transfer news too.\n\nWhat do you think of Tom Dumoulin's #GTNPainCave set up? Hear the latest from Mark Beaumont, and we check out Team Sky's new Race Hub.\n\nTech of the Week features the NGEco power meter from Power2Max. At less than \u20ac500, it adds another quality power meter to the market.\n\n#wattagebazooka goes to Astana rider Brumotti, and to Andy Woodruff for his singlespeed 404 mile 24 hour bike ride! \n\nHack\/bodge of the week yields some great hacks for bike travel and a pretty rad bike dog. \n\nDon't forget to enter our caption competition this week for the chance to win a GCN Camelbak bottle. Good luck! \ud83e\udd1e\n\nFizik will be launching their 2018 range next week - stay tuned! \n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link \ud83d\udc4d  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/lK\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nCheck out Team Sky's Race Hub \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/RaceHub\nCan Dan really run? \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/DanRuns\nPhotos: \u00a9 Bettiniphoto \/ http:\/\/www.bettiniphoto.net\/ & \u00a9Tim De Waele \/ http:\/\/www.tdwsport.com\n\nAbout GCN:\n\nThe Global Cycling Network puts you in the centre of the action: from the iconic climbs of Alpe D\u2019Huez and Mont Ventoux to the cobbles of Flanders, everywhere there is road or pav\u00e9, world-class racing and pro riders, we will be there bringing you action, analysis and unparalleled access every week, every month, and every year.
