Gordon Ramsay investigates a series of blocks who have thousands of shark fins drying out on roofs. He manages to get on top of the roof despite being denied access. This determination allowed him to capture a gold mine of shark fins before they hurry to escape the area.\n\nSubscribe for weekly videos.",
