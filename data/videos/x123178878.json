You are also engaging your body weight, arms, back, shoulders, chest and core to assist you. You would normally use the sprint to either attack from a group or the rush for the finish line.\n\n- Climbing: Riding out of the saddle when climbing allows you to produce more force as you can engage more muscle groups, as well as using your body weight to help put extra weight on the pedals. This will mean more energy consumption though. So it's recommended to sit down on the shallower gradients. \n\n- Stretching: Sometimes you will find it necessary to relieve muscle groups you are using for a prolonged period of time. There is no set time to do this, you can do it whenever, but, your body will tell you when it is aching. If the roads you ride on are undulating, it may not be necessary as you will be in and out of the saddle plenty!\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link \ud83d\udc4d  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/oe\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nHow & When To Change Gear On A Road Bike | GCN's Pro Tips \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/GearChange\nHow To Improve Your Balance On A Bike | GCN's Pro Tips \ud83d\udcf9 http:\/\/gcn.eu\/ob\n\nPhotos: \u00a9 Bettiniphoto \/ http:\/\/www.bettiniphoto.net\/ & \u00a9Tim De Waele \/ http:\/\/www.tdwsport.com\n\nAbout GCN:\n\nThe Global Cycling Network puts you in the centre of the action: from the iconic climbs of Alpe D\u2019Huez and Mont Ventoux to the cobbles of Flanders, everywhere there is road or pav\u00e9, world-class racing and pro riders, we will be there bringing you action, analysis and unparalleled access every week, every month, and every year.
