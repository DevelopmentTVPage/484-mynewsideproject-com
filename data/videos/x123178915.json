As a mobile workshop, the truck must house the spares, and the expertise necessary to keep the team's Factor bikes running smoothly for the race ahead.\n\nNot to be underestimated, the soigneurs also have a crucial job in keeping the teams performing at their best. Truck provisions include laundry facilities and a pantry for fuelling riders before and after stages as well as keeping their kit fresh for each stage.  \n\nFor more on life as a pro cyclist behind the scenes, Dan has a nosey around this tour truck.
