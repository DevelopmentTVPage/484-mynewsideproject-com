Let us know in the comments below \ud83d\udc47\n\nHere are some of Dan's favourite bits of tech that he was lucky enough to get to grips with at the annual pilgrimage to Eurobike.\n\nEyewear giant Oakley released 3 helmet with BOA dial\/wiring for the retention system which is very lightweight and less bulky than some systems found on other helmets.\n\nPark Tools are well renowned as being one of the finest purveyors of tools in the industry, but they don't just stop there, they are also including a beer tray and a chainkeeper, as well as a cork-screw! It's thirsty work fixing and riding bikes after all.\n\nControlTech - They showed us a fully internal cabled Cougar PCS cockpit, very neat. The video shows this in fine detail.\n\nCeramicSpeed released their UFO Drip \"chain coating\" the statistics that we were shown from their tests were very good, interestingly, a noisier chain can be faster than a silent one! \n\nFSA WE Electro\/Hydro Groupset - Plenty of nice features, including the reach adjust on the levers as well as very rounded off disc rotors so there are no sharp edges\n\nPearl Izumi showed off their P.R.O Leader v4 shoes, these feature a seamless upper to minimize pressure points, as well as a super low stack height to give a powerful pedal stroke. Most strikingly was the electroplated sole though, \u2b50\ufe0f very bling\u2b50\ufe0f\n\nLike a chainkeeper? Then check out this one from Feedback Sports\n\nRondo bikes showed off a range of gravel bikes with twin fork tips. Why? So that you can transform a bike from endurance to racing geometry, and vice-versa.\n\nCampagnolo have released SIX new groupsets. There are tge hydraulic disc brake groupsets that have landed and certainly look nice and sleek. To accompany the disc brake groupsets they've released new wheels, including the Bora One DB wheels\nCentaur replaces the Veloce groupset as the entry level groupset.\n\nLook have increased the surface area on their K\u00e9o Blade Carbon pedals and reduced the weight! That's pretty cool isn't it?\n\nThe KTM Revelator was a concept bike at the 2016 Eurobike Show and is now a consumer product, with its hidden cables and lower seat stays, it is a nice looking bike in the familiar KTM colours.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link \ud83d\udc4d  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/mT\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nEurobike 2017: The Future Of Indoor Training?

Let us know how you are finding it in the comments below \ud83d\udc47\n\nEx-professional cyclists Simon Richardson and Matt Stephens are here with all you need to know about starting up with Zwift.\n\nYou will need an account, head over to http:\/\/gcn.eu\/ZwiftBeginner and sign-up, you can start with a free trial.\n\nYou will need an indoor trainer, and something that tells Zwift how fast you are riding.\nFor a basic setup this can be a speed sensor that communicates with Zwift.\nA more advanced setup is using a powermeter which transmits all metrics to the software.\nThe most accurate setup though, is to use a smart trainer. This will also increase\/decrease pedalling resistance dependant on terrain and if you are slipstreaming for instance.\n\nYou will also need a towel, drink, and we advise using a fan to help keep you cool.\nSomething also worth considering is the Zwift app, this is used as a remote control for the features available.\n\nThere are three different worlds that you can ride in, these are:\nWatopia - South Pacific Paradise, 8 routes and 42km of roads\nRichmond - 4 routes and 18.9km of roads\nLondon - 8 routes  and 27.5km of roads\n\nZwift has a calendar to show when the different courses\/routes are available to ride on as well as group rides and races that are being hosted if you wish to join in the fun.\n\nChoosing a route is simple and then you can go for a ride, you can even choose to turn onto a different route as well as doing a U-Turn and riding the other way if you see someone you would like to ride with for example.\n\nThe screen setup shows all the metrics you need, including gradient and where you are on a route\/ride. You can also see where you in comparison to others riding, as well as the watts per kg that they are outputting!\n\nYou can even customise your clothing and bike appearance onscreen, including an unlockable GCN kit! Not forgetting being able to wave at others, flick the elbow and even give other users a 'Ride-on'\n\nThere are plenty of training sessions and workouts on Zwift, including 32 GCN workouts and you can even create your own.\n\nAfter any activity the ride data is displayed and can be saved\/uploaded to your profile on sites such as Strava, Training Peaks etc.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link \ud83d\udc4d http:\/\/gcn.eu\/nr\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nWhat Is Zwift Workout Mode?  \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/zwift-workouts\nGCN Vs.

No, seriously - it's a really, really big box.\n\nThe new generation Wattbike is here. Introducing the Atom, a smart static bike designed for cyclists. That's right, you can now use the Wattbike with your favourite smart training software like Zwift, and so much more. \n\nSimply connect to the Wattbike Hub App to use your phone or tablet as the head unit. Simon talks us through the many advanced functions on the Atom that sets it in a new class from the original Wattbike from 2008.\n\nThe dynamic magnetic resistance system is arguably the most exciting development with the new Atom, which will change the resistance through the pedals automatically when you are using compatible software. \n\nEnter the competition for your chance to win a Wattbike Atom here! \ud83c\udf81\nhttp:\/\/gcn.eu\/WinWattbikeAtom \n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link \ud83d\udc4d http:\/\/gcn.eu\/nE\n\nWatch more on GCN...\nTest your fitness level indoors \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/GCNtestyourfitness\nWattbike indoor 60 minute endurance session  \ud83d\udcf9  http:\/\/gcn.eu\/1O9NaJx\n\nPhotos: \u00a9 Bettiniphoto \/ http:\/\/www.bettiniphoto.net\/ & \u00a9Tim De Waele \/ http:\/\/www.tdwsport.com\n\nAbout GCN:\n\nThe Global Cycling Network puts you in the centre of the action: from the iconic climbs of Alpe D\u2019Huez and Mont Ventoux to the cobbles of Flanders, everywhere there is road or pav\u00e9, world-class racing and pro riders, we will be there bringing you action, analysis and unparalleled access every week, every month, and every year.
