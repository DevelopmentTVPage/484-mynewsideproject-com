    "description": "Proven to be a rapid ride so far this year, Chris Froome is now equipped with the super lightweight Pinarello Dogma F10 X-Light for the Vuelta A Espa\u00f1a. Can it help Team Sky secure a second Grand Tour in 2017? \n\nSubscribe to GCN: http:\/\/gcn.eu\/SubscribeToGCN\nGet exclusive GCN gear in the GCN store! http:\/\/gcn.eu\/lV\n\nDan Lloyd is at the start of the 2017 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a to check out Froomey's ride set up for the flatter stages on the final Grand Tour of the season. Pinarello's new carbon lay up gives a more lightweight mode of the F10, now named the X-Light.\n\nWith a custom paint job featuring the signature Rhino representing charity Unite For Wildlife, it's unmistakably the bike of Team Sky's lead man Chris Froome.\n\nWhat do you think of Froome's new ride?
