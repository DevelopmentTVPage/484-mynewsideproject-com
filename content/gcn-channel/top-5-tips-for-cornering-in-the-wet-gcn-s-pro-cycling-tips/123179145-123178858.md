Wider tyres will give you a greater contact patch than a narrow tyre, and as they allow you to run lower pressures, this effect is amplified further\n\nAvoid drain covers and white lines: Grip on metal drain covers and white lines will be basically non-existent in the wet, so avoid them where possible. If you can\u2019t, then momentarily straighten the bike up while you cross them.\n\nBraking: Braking quite simply takes longer in the wet. Make sure you always start braking a little earlier than you would in the dry. This is even more important as braking while turning in the wet is a sure fire way to get acquainted with the tarmac!\n\nGive yourself more room: If you\u2019re riding in a group in the wet, just back off the rider in front a little bit. That way, if anything goes wrong with them, you\u2019ll have a bit more time to react.\n\nIf you'd like to contribute captions and video info in your language, here's the link ",
