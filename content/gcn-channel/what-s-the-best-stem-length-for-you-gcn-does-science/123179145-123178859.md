But mountain bikers change stem length depending on the handling characteristics they want for their bike. So do different stem lengths change the handling of road bike? Dan and Si do some GCN science to find out.\n\nTesting three different stem lengths, 80mm, 110mm, 140mm, Dan and Si perform two different skill challenges, a 'suburban challenge' and a descending challenge. Will there be any difference in times between the stem lengths?\n\nLet us know what you think of the trend towards longer stems and smaller frames in the comments down below ",
