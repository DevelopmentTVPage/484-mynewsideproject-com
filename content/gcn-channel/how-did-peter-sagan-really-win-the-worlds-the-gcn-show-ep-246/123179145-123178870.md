Remember to vote in our poll at 12.25 - is this the death of the front derailleur? \n\nWe congratulate Annemiek van Vleuten, Tom Domoulin, Elena Pirrone and Tom Pidcock for their success at the World Championships. Not to forget Chantal Blaak in the women's road race. More racing news from across the pond, with victories from Van der Poel and Cant.\n\nIn this week's Wattage Bazooka we look to Lars van der Haar and viewer Bryan Griffith for his epic ride! \n\nHack\/Bodge of the Week throws up some interesting one this week - some looking safer than others! \n\nWell done Paul Stenson on your new Wattbike!
