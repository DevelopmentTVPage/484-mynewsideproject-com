    "description": "Flatbreads are a traditionally middle-eastern treat and are deliciously versatile, and available from most supermarkets. Here Gordon transforms them by adding thinly sliced fresh fennel, with toasted aromatic fennel seeds and tangy feta cheese, finishing the dish with a sticky and sweet pomegranate molasses. A must-try.\n\nSubscribe for weekly cooking videos. \n\nIf you liked this clip check out the rest of Gordon's channels:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/gordonramsay\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/kitchennightmares\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/thefword",
